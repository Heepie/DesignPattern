# DesignPattern

## What is Design Pattern?
> Design patterns represent the **best practices** used by experienced object-oriented software developers. Design patterns are **solutions** to general problems that software developers faced during software development. These solutions were obtained by trial and error by numerous software developers over quite a substantial period of time.

### 1. Strategy Pattern
####1) What is Strategy Pattern? (Keyword: Selection)
The strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a behavioural software design pattern that enables **an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime**.

### 2. Adapter Pattern
####1) What is Adapter Pattern? (Keyword: existing class, reuse)
The adapter pattern is a software design pattern (also known as Wrapper, an alternative naming shared with the Decorator pattern) that allows the interface of **an existing class to be used as another interface**. It is often used to make existing classes work with others **without modifying their source code**.

### 3. Template Pattern
####1) What is Template Pattern? (Keyword: skeleton, redefine certain steps)
The template method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. It lets one **redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure**.
